                        <p><strong>Software & DevOps Engineer | Automation, Security & Innovation Expert</strong>
                        I am a passionate Software and DevOps Engineer with over 15 years of experience in developing software systems for
                        diverse environments, including industrial automation, enterprise solutions, smart home technology, and gaming.
                        Throughout my career, I have specialized in designing and managing advanced security, automation, and control
                        systems, working across industries such as industrial automation, home automation, and business management
                        systems for bars, restaurants, and fast-food chains.
                        My expertise spans from developing PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) solutions to building complex systems using
                        Python, PHP, C, JAVA, and modern high-level automation languages. I have a strong background in technical design,
                        software development, DevOps engineering, and CI/CD pipelines, with a relentless focus on process improvement and
                        software deployment optimization. I am proficient in working with major repositories and release management tools
                        such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
                        I have extensive experience integrating security systems like Hikvision and worker safety solutions for tunnel
                        operations, such as Blueup, leading the implementation of access control technologies and real-time monitoring
                        solutions. My goal is to ensure efficient, secure, and easy-to-manage systems. With a results-driven approach and
                        strong problem-solving skills, I deliver innovative, high-impact solutions.
                        I firmly believe that true innovation stems from collaboration between development and operations teams. My passion
                        for continuous learning fuels my growth, allowing me to tackle new challenges and implement cutting-edge
                        technological solutions.
                        I am always seeking new ways to leverage my expertise to create safer, more efficient, and technologically advanced
                        environments.
                        My ultimate goal? To deliver meaningful products and high-quality code.</p>

                                <h3>Software Developer</h3>
                                During the COVID-19 pandemic, I co-founded "Avanti il SUD", a technology outreach program designed to empower small businesses and artisans across Southern Italy (from Battipaglia to Rende). This initiative provided critical digital tools to help traditional enterprises survive pandemic disruptions and modernize their operations.
                                Key Achievements:
                                    • Enabled digital transformation for 50+ local businesses
                                    • Implemented process automation solutions for operations management
                                    • Developed hybrid physical-to-digital (phygital) commerce models
                                    • Reduced business closure rates in participating communities by an estimated 40%
                                Project Scope:
                                    • Automated workflow systems for artisans and retailers
                                    • E-commerce platform integration for traditional stores
                                    • Digital literacy training for non-technical business owners
                                    • Sustainable business model development
                                Working with a cross-functional team of experts, we helped businesses:
                                    • Transition to remote operations during lockdowns
                                    • Implement inventory management systems
                                    • Develop online customer acquisition strategies
                                    • Build financial resilience against economic shocks
                                This initiative demonstrated how targeted technology adoption can preserve traditional businesses while preparing them for modern market challenges.
